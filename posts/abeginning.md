While when starting a blog, one really should have something to say, I think
it suffices at the start to spend a bit of time setting up Git Pages, a template engine 
and toying with format, blog names and setup.

I will take the time, though, to ponder a bit of a list of topics I intend to
talk about.  Hopefully, when I get through that list, I'll have developed
enough of a blogging habit that this will become more second nature - and
hopefully I'll have developed a tone and flow that works for me.  We'll see.
I expect this blog to be a mix of social stuff - how to get along in a dev
organization - and technical stuff - probably spawned from rants and mis-steps
and mistakes. 

Till then, those topics : 

1. How to Ask For Help - None of us can know it all, we all need to ask for help and we all need to give help. Here's how to do it without wasting everyone's time. 

2. Mentoring - bringing along junior programmers without boring them to death with 'in my day'...

3. Dependency Injection - why I prefer constructor dependency injection over frameworks... (or "Why I hate Magic")

4. Diversity - our industry sucks at diversity. My thoughts...

5. What will survive from Agile - while processes will inevitably move on, some things will stay with us

6. Data visualization - what's the big deal, anyways? Some tools and some ways of playing with data.

7. Angular - so is it really that new?
 
One topic a week? Maybe?  We'll see.  I am hoping to develop that pattern... I have more than an article in me on each of those subjects, but let's get a breadth of topics out before I do anything at length.
