title = Do you program for FUN?
tags = programminglife philosophy
+++

I grew up programming - first on an Apple IIe, then on a 286, then on through 
the years.  I always wanted to be a programmer.. and here I am, thirty-odd
years later, still living the dream.

But I'm an enterprise programmer, which can be a grind sometimes - there's
projects that are awesome, cool and new and then there's times where you are
grinding out some maintenance stuff.  Sometimes you're learning stuff like crazy
in your day job - and sometimes you feel like you are treading water.  But we
all know (or at least, I hope you do) that programming can be amazing - you are
doing as close to magic as is possible in this world.  You are taking nothing
and making something happen.  It is an awesome thing and it can be serious fun,
and the way you make it happen is by making it happen in your spare time, since
it won't always come for work.

So, with that in mind, how do you program for *fun*?  I've always done pet
projects - silly games, web stuff, toy projects to learn new languages or
technologies, microprocessor stuff for electronics projects.  What I've learned
over the years, though, is that I need to tailor what I'm doing at home to 
what's absorbing my brain at work.  If I'm in a grind at work, then at home
I will be doing things that are ambitious - a big game project, a new language
that is hot right now, a framework I might want to learn - even the fancy
new features of the next version of Java, if the project I'm on is dragging 
its heels about upgrading.  On the other hand, if I'm drinking from the firehose
- new things are coming fast and furious, like if I'm starting a new project
with new technology at work, well then that's the time to have a change of pace
at home, something more bite sized.  

My favourite little bite sized bit of programming is to grab a microcontroller
and a programming language/framework for it (I'm currently keen on 
[Sming](https://github.com/SmingHub/Sming/wiki) - a C library for the
ESP8266 microcontroller, which is a $2 jelly-bean micro with WIFI and decent
general IO).  The challenges with a microcontroller are so different than
my daily job, it makes the perfect change of pace.  And it is an excuse to
break out the soldering iron and make something that does something physical.

Of course, microcontrollers may not be your thing. But I encourage you to
figure out what does work for you for the bite-sized chunks.  I think it is 
important to get in a habit of working on projects at home - work stuff is
work stuff, but having your own stuff lets you remember the magic that
programmer really is.
